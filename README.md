## 1. Why should I do this?
Stealing an excerpt from [https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications](https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications)...

_The demand for Apache Cassandra™ and NoSQL skills is skyrocketing, with Cassandra developers commanding **31% higher salaries**, the highest of any database technology._

_**An Apache Cassandra™ Administrator Associate Certification** or **Apache Cassandra™ Developer Associate Certification** is the best way to get started learning and mastering the popular NoSQL database used by teams at Apple, Netflix, Sony, Uber, and thousands more._

_An official certification helps you gain confidence in your knowledge of Apache Cassandra™ and increases opportunities for career advancement._

## 3. Practice questions
As part of this workshop we have provided a set of 15 practice questions. These questions use the same style and form you can expect in the actual exams and will give you an idea of what to expect. 

We highly suggest you run through these and test yourself. Each question will have a hidden answer. Try and answer them first before revealing the solution.
